# Codewars

Here are a couple of sollutions from codewars. I think code should always be readable so I don't try the shortest solution. Instead I try to make helper functions and write out so that afterwards it is more understandable.

## What is codewars?
It's a website where you can practice interesting code problems be it in javascript, c or java.
